	\opening{Dear RecipientName,}


The UW-ANS Student Chapter greatly appreciates your long history of sponsoring our activities.  With your significant financial help, our chapter has yet again achieved national recognition in 2009 by winning the Glasstone Award for the fourth time in five years. This coveted award is given to the student chapter that demonstrates outstanding member involvement in the nuclear field and service to the community. 

We are grateful for your distinguished support and recognize that without your financial backing, our student chapter could not make such outstanding achievements or offer all of our current activities to nuclear engineering students at UW-Madison.  Our executive committee has planned to continue several activities for this coming year that promote professional development, thoughts from a younger generation, and casual networking conversations.

We would appreciate consideration of the following proposal to continue to help defray our costs. In particular, we would appreciate your contribution to the professional development of students by helping them attend ANS conferences. The following section provides a detailed description of the ANS activity that we are asking you to consider. 

\paragraph{Professional Development – Assisting ANS Members to Attend Student Conference}
Student conferences are a great opportunity for our members to network with other students, leading researchers, and companies in the nuclear industry.  This opportunity will allow ANS members to work on their presentation skills, participate in technical presentations, and network with professionals.  With your financial help, we were able to send 11 students to the 2009 student conference at the University of Florida last year. This year, our executive committee has plans to heavily emphasize the importance of this event and to facilitate travel to and from the University of Michigan by renting a charter bus. This step promises to boost attendance and economize travel costs. We anticipate 20 students will join us this year.  In the past, Dominion has contributed \$100 per student to help defray the cost of travel; however, with the proposal of a charter bus, we expect to greatly lower costs, allowing more students to attend. Our ANS chapter would be grateful if you would consider extending your financial support by contributing \$75 per student for 2010.

The total to sponsor this ANS activity is approximately \$1,500 but will depend on how many students attend this year’s student conference.  We appreciate your consideration of this proposal and hope that you will continue to support our chapter.
If you have any questions, please feel free to call or email. 




	\closing{Sincerely,}

 \end{letter}
